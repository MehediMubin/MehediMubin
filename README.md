Hey, I am a Software Engineer who has a keen interest in learning and tweaking low-level stuff.

I am a huge fan of open-source and I don't lose any opportunity to be a part of it.

**My philosophy is simple: Build systems, not just software.**
I am on a journey to expand my horizons by exploring diverse engineering genres. My goal isn't to chase trends, but to craft resilient systems that solve real problems, ensuring I can look back with pride on a diverse portfolio of solutions.
